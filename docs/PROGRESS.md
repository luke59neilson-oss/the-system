### Setup session · 2026-10-21 13:45–14:05 UTC
- Repo created by Luke; docs written; roadmap revised after a Sonnet review
  (see DECISIONS D14).
- Verified from the workspace: push to branches incl. workflow files; GitHub
  Actions runs on this private repo (test workflow green); npm registry;
  Electron and electron-builder binary downloads; vitest 5 runs; Playwright
  1.64 drives `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`.
- Verified blocked: deleting remote branches, pushing tags, GitHub API writes.
  A leftover `perm-test` branch exists on the remote; ignore it.
- Not yet verified from an unattended run: `add_repo` without confirmation,
  push to main, reviewer subagents on `sonnet`/`fable`. The first scheduled
  run records these in its preflight.
- Next: M0.1.

### Run a5d530b3 · 2026-10-21 14:12–14:53 UTC
- Preflight: `add_repo` not needed (repo already attached and cloned); push to
  main works (lock commit pushed); `npm view vitest version` → 5.0.5; reviewer
  subagents on `sonnet` work (fresh context, different model from the builder).
- Orient: no answers in QUESTIONS.md; no CI runs existed yet. A concurrent
  docs commit (52283a9, walking-skeleton milestone MS and preview builds) landed
  mid-run; merged it, and follow its work order (M0 → M1.1–M1.5 → M1.13 →
  M2.1–M2.3 → MS → M1.6…).
- Finished: M0.1 Monorepo scaffold, M0.2 CI, M0.3 LAN server skeleton,
  M1.1 Rules config, M1.2 Character model (all reviewed by Sonnet; see
  REVIEW-LOG.md).
- Tests: 134 unit tests (10 files), 2 e2e (M0.1). Engine line coverage 99.1%
  (floor 90% set in vitest.config.ts).
- CI: green on f6a0b8e, fdfd298 and 7b414c5 (latest code on main).
- Reviews: 5 items, 8 rounds, 0 High; every Medium fixed (two left by design:
  M4.9 id-keyed config edits, D22).
- Toolchain notes: TypeScript pinned to 6.0.x (typescript-eslint does not yet
  support TS 7, D18). Node 22 in CI.
- Open `wip/*` branches: none.
- New question: Q9 starting World Stability (default 100).
- Next: M1.3 Event-sourced core.
- Blockers: none.

### Run 3b746078 · 2026-10-21 15:07–15:47 UTC
- Preflight: `add_repo` tool not offered in this session; repo already cloned
  and attached, fetch/ff-merge worked. Lock pushed to main. `npm view vitest
  version` → 5.0.5. Reviewer subagents on `sonnet` work (fresh context,
  different model from the builder).
- Orient: no answers in QUESTIONS.md; latest CI run on main green (7b414c5).
- Finished: M1.3 Event-sourced core, M1.4 XP and leveling, M1.5 Free points
  (each reviewed by Sonnet in 2 rounds; see REVIEW-LOG.md).
- Tests: 221 unit tests (15 files) incl. fixed-seed property test (seed
  20261021) and three frozen golden logs (basic, xp, freepoints). Engine line
  coverage 99.15% (floor 90%).
- CI: green on 1a7c6d0 … c8d859f (every code commit this run).
- Reviews: 3 items, 6 rounds, 0 High; Mediums fixed except two kept by design
  and logged (D34 create events store inputs; D35 class spread uses a
  cumulative highest-deficit split, raised as Q10).
- New decisions D27–D38; new question Q10 (class spread rounding).
- Open `wip/*` branches: none.
- Next: M1.13 Player projection (then M2.1–M2.3, MS).
- Blockers: none.

### Run 647c5fd1 · 2026-10-21 16:06–16:53 UTC
- Preflight: `add_repo` not offered in this session; repo already cloned, fetch/ff-merge worked. Lock pushed to main. `npm view vitest version` → 5.0.5. Reviewer subagents on `sonnet` work (fresh context, different model from the builder).
- Orient: no answers in QUESTIONS.md; latest CI run on main green (b02ec4f).
- Finished: M1.13 Player projection, M2.1 Persistence, M2.2 Live protocol and authority (each reviewed by Sonnet in 2 rounds; see REVIEW-LOG.md). M2.2 was built on `wip/M2.2` and fast-forwarded into main once clean (the branch stays on the remote; nothing left on it).
- Tests: 279 unit/integration tests (21 files) incl. the projection canary over 1,000 random states (seed 20261022) and a live GM + 2 players canary over every player frame and public HTTP body; 2 e2e (M0.1). Engine line coverage ≈99% (floor 90%).
- CI: green on every code commit pushed to main this run through 2fe68fd; 84c8d69 (M2.2) pushed at the end of the run.
- Reviews: 3 items, 6 rounds; 1 High (M2.2 GM HTTP gate bypass via `/%61pi`, fixed and tested); all Mediums fixed or logged (D44 one event per command; D46 GM key over LAN).
- New decisions D39–D46; new questions Q11 (party pool bars), Q12 (GM from another device).
- Open `wip/*` branches: none unfinished (`wip/M2.2` is merged).
- Next: M2.3 Join helper, then MS.1–MS.6, MS.A.
- Blockers: none.
