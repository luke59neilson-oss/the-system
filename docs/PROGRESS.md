### Setup session · 2026-10-21 13:45–14:05 UTC
- Repo created by Luke; docs written; roadmap revised after a Sonnet review
  (see DECISIONS D14).
- Verified from the workspace: push to branches incl. workflow files; GitHub
  Actions runs on this private repo (test workflow green); npm registry;
  Electron and electron-builder binary downloads; vitest 5 runs; Playwright
  1.64 drives `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`.
- Verified blocked: deleting remote branches, pushing tags, GitHub API writes.
  A leftover `perm-test` branch exists on the remote; ignore it.
- Not yet verified from an unattended run: `add_repo` without confirmation,
  push to main, reviewer subagents on `sonnet`/`fable`. The first scheduled
  run records these in its preflight.
- Next: M0.1.
